# TrackForMe
This is the repo for our Hack.summit() project.

Have you ever waste time verifiying over and over again the same page waiting for a change? If your answer was yes, don't do that again! Our extension track this change for you!

You'll be able to track words, values, designs and more! Follow the simple steps to setup what you're waiting for and when that happens you'll be notified.
